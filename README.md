# Workstation Setup

This project automates the process of setting up a new Pivotal Labs machine using a simple [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) script.

## Getting Started

**Warning: the automation script is currently aggressive about what it does and will overwrite vim configurations, bash-it configurations, etc.**

- Update to [El Capitan](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1018109117)
- Install [Xcode 7](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)

Then open up the OS X Terminal and run the following commands:

```sh
$ cd workspace
$ git clone https://github.com/pivotal/workstation-setup.git
$ cd workstation-setup
```

### Engineering Machine

If you're setting up an engineering machine run the following:

```sh
$ ./engineer.sh
```

### Designer Machine

If you're setting up a design machine run the following:

```sh
$ ./designer.sh
```

To see which applications were installed, visit [applications-designer.sh]  (https://github.com/pivotal/workstation-setup/blob/master/scripts/applications-designer.sh)
